Modal estimation deals with the problem of identifying parameters of structures ‚Äì natural frequencies, damping factors and associated mode shapes. Eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) is considered as one of most robust and accurate methodologies in modal parameters identification. ERA realization deals with the problem of fitting a minimal state-space given a quantity of measured impulsive responses functions (IRF) data taken from a structural system. Modal parameters are extracted from an eigenvalue problem solution of the state matrix. Generally, modal parameters identification for lightly damped systems has highest levels of accuracy. Proportional and non-proportional viscous damping models are the most common way used to describe dissipative mechanism in structural systems under vibration. Accurate estimates of modal parameters from modal test data are very important to obtain good dynamical description of such systems. The presence of viscous damping in the system to be identified can produce a decrease in accuracy of identified modal parameters. This article presents a searching on the capability of extracting modal parameters with ERA for structural systems in the presence of various levels of viscous damping using IRF data obtained numerically from a five degrees of freedom mechanical system. In addition, noisy IRF signals are also considered.
